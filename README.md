Boilerplate for Game Projects using ThreeJs, Webpack & Typescript.

Made by following a tutorial by Zack West.
https://www.alpharithms.com/threejs-scene-setup-typescript-and-webpack-194215/

Build:
node_modules\.bin\webpack

Run using python: (Guide recommends dev server for webpack. Probably worth looking in to)
py -m http.server

Notes:
- Guide recommended setting up watcher for auto-compiling (Definetly worth looking into)
